# Script Descriptions
This is a small collection the more useful scripts i have written over the years.

## sidmenu
This script reads oratab entries into an array
then presents them in a menu format in order to set the correct
oracle user environment on servers with multiple databases.

Variables:
OTAB: should be set to the location of the oratab file
PATH and LD_LIBRARY: path might need adjusted

To use script type: 

``` . sidmenu```

## Development
If you get some utility out of these scripts let me know
